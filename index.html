      <h2 id="desc-h">Description</h2>
      <p>As a child, I was fortunate to have attended a blind school where I received support in various aspects of my life such as assistive technology, braille courses and adaptive sports, however, I always lacked the comfort of having people I could talk to, who had the lived experience of a blind or low vision individual. And that is why as a tutor of the visually impaired, I not only offer personalised braille and screen reader training, tailored advice on pathways for the future, and strategies for a more independent daily life, I also offer mentorship. A space of understanding. A place where each and every one of my clients feels heard and validated. Because while blindness might mean lack of sight, it does not mean lack of vision.</p>

      <h2 id="expect-h">What To Expect</h2>
      <p>Each session will vary from between 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the preference of the client.</p>
      <p>The first session will begin with a discussion about your current situation, short term and then long term goals as an individual who is blind or has low vision.</p>
      <p>We will then discuss how we can work together to implement strategies that will help you reach those goals.</p>
      <p>Every session will begin with a check-in of how you've been and what you feel you need from the session. Zoom will be used to carry out sessions, and parents are more than welcome to be a part of these sessions.</p>
